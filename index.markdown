  Hi! My name is Kristin and I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science + Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. I am advised by<a href="http://www.eleanororourke.com/index.html">Professor Eleanor O'Rourke</a> in the<a href="https://delta.northwestern.edu">Delta Lab</a>.  
<br>
In my research, I seek to understand how small moments during the programming process shape students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy in computer science. To this end, I am conducting design-based research to create an AI tool that supports human-centered collaboration during pair programming.  
<br>
Before I started at Northwestern, I graduated with a B.S. in mathematics, B.S.Ed. in secondary education, and a minor in computer science from Loyola University Chicago in May 2023. I student taught in high school math and computer science courses in a Chicago Public High School, and also taught summer school math classes.
