  Hi! My name is Kristin and I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science + Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. I am advised by <a href="http://www.eleanorourke.com/index.html">Professor Eleanor O'Rourke</a> in the <a href="https://delta.northwestern.edu">Delta Lab</a>.  
<br><br>
Through my research, I try to understand how small moments during the programming process shape students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy in computer science. Lately, this has meant exploring the side-talk between students in an introductory undergraduate computer science course and understanding how students' self-assessments of their ability are shaped by their social context.  
<br><br>
Before coming to Northwestern, I graduated with a B.S. in mathematics, B.S.Ed. in secondary education, and a minor in computer science from Loyola University Chicago. I student taught in high school math and computer science courses in a Chicago Public High School, and have also taught summer school math classes.
