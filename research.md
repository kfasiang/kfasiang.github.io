In my research, I try to understand how students work at the edges of formal computer science learning environments to create spaces where they can belong and succeed. To do this, <u>I focus on students' (sometimes unsanctioned and unorthodox) interactions with their peers and appropriations of technologies.</u> 
</p>
<p>
Some key words for my research are: self-efficacy, belonging, identity, learning pathways, accessibility, and human computer interaction.  
</p>

<p>
Some of my past work includes:
</p>

* Investigating the interactions students have with peers and technology "to the side" of a main activity in their computer science classes and how they contribute to learning and belonging.
* Understanding storylines students use when evaluating their belonging in computer science and when self-assessing during the programming process. 
* Creating a model AI assignment for middle and high school students to learn about bias and ethical concerns with large language models.

<p>
Currently, I am working on:
</p>

* Identifying moments that influence students' sense of belonging and self-assessments while they collaboratively program with a peer.
* Scoping a project to understand how students with disabilties use and create their own assistive technologies to engage with computer science learning.
