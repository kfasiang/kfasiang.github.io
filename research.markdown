In my research, I try to understand how students' self-assessments at small moments during the programming process &mdash; like looking up syntax or stopping to think &mdash; are shaped by the social context of a computer science class. Since these small, commonplace moments can inform the narratives students go on to tell about themselves as computer science students, how can we bring about more supportive peer-to-peer interactions in these moments to help students see themselves as capable of succeeding in computer science?  
<br><br>
Some of my past work includes:<br>
<ul>  
    <li>Investigating the interactions students have "to the side" of a main activity in their computer science classes and how they contribute to computer science learning and belonging.
    <li>Understanding common concepts students use when evaluating their belonging in computer science and when self-assessing during the programming process.</li> 
    <li>Creating a model AI assignment for middle and high school students to learn about bias and ethical concerns with large language models.</li>
</ul>
My current work builds on the first of these threads to:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Identify moments that influence students' sense of belonging and self-assessments while they collaboratively program with a peer.</li> 
    <li>Design an AI tool to support peer-to-peer interactions and collaboration during the collaborative programming process.</li>
</ul>
